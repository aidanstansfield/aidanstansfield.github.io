This isn't so much a post, just a share of something I did. So last week I gave a talk to the [UQ Cyber Squad][uqcs] called **"Introduction to Web Security"**. Since WebSec is massive and this was a talk for beginners, I decided to come at this from the angle of *WebSec for CTFs*, since it serves as an easy entry point to those not familiar with the theory and tools, and it's an area I have some decent experience in.

That being said, here's the links:
