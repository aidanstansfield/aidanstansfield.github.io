# Aidan's Blog
Here you can find the source code for building my blog, as well as the source for the blog itself under the master branch
## Building
I use [jgd](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy) to automagically build and deploy my pages to the master branch!
Note, since this is a "User site", the only available publishing source is the master branch.
`cd aidanstansfield.github.io && bundle exec jgd --branch master --branch-from source`
