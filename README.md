# Aidan's Blog
Here you can find the source code for building my blog, as well as the source for the blog itself under the gh-pages branch
## Building
I use [jgd](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy) to automagically build and deploy my pages to the gh-pages branch!
`cd aidanstansfield.github.io && bundle exec jdg`
